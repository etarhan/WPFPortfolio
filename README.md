# WPFPortfolio

Found this project buried in an email I've sent some years ago (I think it was as a part of some traineeship application). It's one of my first experiences coding an application. Based on the send date of the email I made this when I had about 50 days of coding experience (meaning I hadn't written a single line of code before those 50 days). I am uploading this here so I don't lose track of it again :)
